### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As an ardent Computer Science major at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, I thrive on dissecting and devising novel solutions to intricate challenges. My technical repertoire is robust, boasting proficiency in Python, Java, and C++, and many other languages. This skill set has been honed across a spectrum of projects, including the development of a full stack applications, games and web extensions.

My distinction lies in the blend of an unwavering work ethic, a perpetual desire to learn, and an ability to flourish within team-based settings. It's my firm belief that my dedication and knowledge are catalysts for collective success.

I invite you to peruse my repositories and reach out for collaboration. ðŸš€
